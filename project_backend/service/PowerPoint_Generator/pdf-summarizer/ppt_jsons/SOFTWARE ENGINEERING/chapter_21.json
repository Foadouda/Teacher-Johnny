            "script": "Hello everyone, and welcome to this presentation on Aspect-Oriented Software Engineering! We'll start with an introduction to the concepts of AOSE. We'll cover how standard programming abstractions sometimes fall short when addressing widespread concerns in a system. As you can see on the slide, concerns like security, logging, and error handling can become tangled within the core code. AOSE offers a solution by using aspects, which are then automatically combined at specific points in the code, creating a cleaner and more modular structure."

                "Separating concerns improves understandability and reduces code complexity in programs.",
                "Changes should be localized, affecting only a small number of program units to be easy to implement.",
                "Primary functionality should be separated from secondary features that support overall operation.",
                "A concern reflects stakeholder requirements, including functional, quality, and organizational goals."
            ],
            "script": "Moving on, this slide focuses on the principle of the separation of concerns. Separating concerns in our code can significantly improve its understandability and reduce complexity. This also allows us to localize changes, meaning updates only affect a small portion of the code. The slide emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between primary functionality and features that support the overall system operation. A concern is an area of interest to stakeholders, ranging from functionality to security, and even organizational goals."

                "Tangling occurs when a module includes code for different, unrelated requirements, confusing its function.",
                "Scattering occurs when implementing a single concern requires changes across many modules, making evolution difficult.",
                "Cross-cutting concerns, like security and logging, often lead to tangling and scattering issues.",
                "Traditional abstractions are inadequate to handle concerns that cut across different modules and functions."
            ],
            "script": "This slide highlights the main problems that AOSE aims to solve: Tangling and Scattering. Tangling makes it harder to understand what a module should be doing. Scattering complicates program changes because changes must be spread across multiple modules. Cross-cutting concerns are hard to manage using traditional programming."

                "A pointcut is a statement that specifies when and where advice should be executed, targeting specific join points.",
                "Aspect weaving is the automatic process of integrating advice into the code at specified join points."
            ],
            "script": "Here, we introduce some core AOSE terms. Advice is the actual code that implements the concern; It\u2019s the \u201cwhat\u201d. A Join Point is a place to apply the advice, it\u2019s the \u201cwhere\u201d. A Pointcut is how you select the join points; it\u2019s the rule that defines when. And lastly, Aspect weaving is the compilation phase when the advice code gets inserted at the selected join points. Think of it like automatically adding instructions to specific locations in your code."

                "If authentication fails, the update is terminated, ensuring only authorized users can modify data.",
                "This encapsulates authentication logic separate from update logic, improving modularity and reducing tangling."
            ],
            "script": "Let's look at a simplified example. An authentication aspect ensures a user is verified before updating the database. This aspect is designed to run before any method that updates database. The key is that the authentication code is defined completely separately."

            "script": "Looking at the earlier phases like requirements and design, we can now separate out concerns. When done effectively, this improves traceability \u2013 meaning it's easier to follow a requirement from concept to code. Reduced complexity makes reasoning and modification easier, and the design is generally more flexible and able to adapt."

            "script": "However, there are issues as always! Testing aspect-oriented programs can be a bit tricky. It's not always possible to read the code sequentially. Traditional test coverage metrics can be difficult to apply. You will have to take a different look at testing when using aspects. And potential interference between aspects is another concern as you test these interwoven modules."

            "script": "This slide details the difficulties. First, Aspect weaving means code inspection is a no-go. Code is harder to read, meaning special tools are needed. It's harder to guarantee a certain amount of code coverage. The lack of adequate testing and code-reading makes it harder to apply AOSE in large projects."
