It's not just about finding bugs, but about building a culture and process that ensures quality from the very beginning. We'll see how this involves setting standards, measuring progress, and ultimately delivering a better product."

            "script": "Now, let's define what we mean by 'quality' in the context of software. Unlike manufacturing, where quality is about conforming to exact specifications, software quality is more nuanced. It's not just about the code; it's about how it behaves, how easily it can be changed, and how well it meets user needs and expectations."

Standards provide a framework for quality by setting clear expectations for what\u2019s to be developed and how the software should be created. It ensures communication is improved across the organization as it creates standard processes."

QA plays a critical role in ensuring that each task is reviewed against the standards and is executed properly, as well as, providing reporting on the product's progress and quality."

Next, the review team gathers for a formal review meeting where they walk through the product. Finally, the review team closes out, with follow-up actions and checks."
