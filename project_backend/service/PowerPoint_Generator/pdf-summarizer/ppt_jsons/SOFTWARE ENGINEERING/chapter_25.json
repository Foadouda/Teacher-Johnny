This practice is vital for managing evolving software systems, particularly in team settings and with distributed teams. CM becomes a critical SQA component in this management. It addresses challenges such as potential code loss, change conflicts, and version control, ensuring streamlined integration and overall system cohesion."

Version management provides meticulous tracking of component versions, minimizing conflicts between developers. Then, system building creates executables by assembling necessary components. And finally, Release management streamlines the release process, including preparation and tracking of system distributions."

These requests can cover from new functionality additions to identifying new problems. This process is managed through a Change Request Form or CRF, and captures every important change details. Using CRFs offers instant snapshots of its status."

This is followed by assessing the cost for implementation. In the final phase, the approved changes are applied to the affected modules to complete the loop."
