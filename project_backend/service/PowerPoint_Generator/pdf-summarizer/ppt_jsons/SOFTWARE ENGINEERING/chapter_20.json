                "Key considerations include resource constraints (memory, processing power, battery life), and reliability.",
                "Real-time requirements necessitate timely responses to external events for correct operation."

            "script": "Good morning! This presentation focuses on Chapter 20, 'Embedded Software'. We will begin by understanding the basic nature of embedded systems.  These integrate hardware and software, dedicating resources to handle specific tasks. I'll explain where we see them and why resource constraints and real-time needs are so important."

                "Platform selection is crucial, considering hardware, RTOS, and middleware based on resource, power, and timing needs.",
                "Stimulus/response identification defines the system's reactions to external triggers from sensors, actuators.",
                "Timing analysis ensures deadlines are met, considering worst-case execution times and process scheduling.",

            "script": "Next, let's dive into the design process itself.  Key steps involve selecting the execution platform (hardware and RTOS), and we will see how platform factors greatly determine the design. Other factors include detailing external triggers, performing timing analysis, and developing the process architecture."

We'll cover patterns such as 'Observe and React', which is essential for monitoring, the 'Environmental Control' pattern for managing external environments, and the 'Process Pipeline' pattern for rapid data transformation."
