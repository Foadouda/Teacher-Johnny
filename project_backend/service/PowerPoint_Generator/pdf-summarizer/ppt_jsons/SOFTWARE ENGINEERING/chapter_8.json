            "script": "Here, we will look into the fundamental difference between verification and validation. Think of Verification as checking our work according to standards. Validation, on the other hand, is checking that the standards that we are following are even the right thing for the users."

Testing requires that the system be executable, so we can have many different people participate in inspections, even those who do not have testing environments configured."

Key components like test cases, test data, and test results work together to ensure the software functions correctly. The tests are analyzed and test reports are created.

Finally, we test the whole system. These activities are all geared to defect testing, as we want to find and fix issues before we turn the software over."
