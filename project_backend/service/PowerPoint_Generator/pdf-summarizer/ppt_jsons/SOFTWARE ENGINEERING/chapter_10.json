Key takeaway: It's not just about the tech; it's about the people and the processes surrounding the technology. I will walk you through in this series of slides how important it is that software engineers have to remember the holistic view of the system, as they dive deep into security and dependability of these systems."

            "script": "Now, let's dive a bit deeper and look at the nature of complexity. In these systems, it's very important to remember that the systems components, while they do contribute, must be understood, or else system failures will occur. Take a look at the slide and you'll see some key points to consider. "

This means that you can implement great technology with great processes, but that one failure in any layer will affect the operations within the other layers. Laws and social regulations are in place to control the operations, for example."

People don't always react to systems the same way each time, as many external factors affect our behavior. Look at the slide and you will see a few key ideas. "

Of course, a formal, test-based process is what is generally expected, so keep in mind that in these steps you need to take time to implement extensive verification and validation to discover what may be incorrect. It's also vital to account for human limitations as well."
