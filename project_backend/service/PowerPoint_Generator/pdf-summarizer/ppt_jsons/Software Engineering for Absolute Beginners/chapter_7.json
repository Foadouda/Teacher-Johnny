                "REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to perform CRUD operations.",
                "Resources are identified by URLs, representing data that the API exposes to its clients.",
                "APIs return data, generally in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation), a human-readable format.",

            ],
            "script": "Before we start coding, let's understand the core principles of REST. REST relies on standard HTTP methods like GET for retrieving data, POST for creating, PUT or PATCH for updating, and DELETE for removing resources. These resources are identified by unique URLs. The data is typically exchanged in JSON format, which is easy to read and parse. Each request should contain all necessary information, making the server stateless. We will also touch upon HATEOAS, a less common but important REST principle."

It's based on key-value pairs, similar to Python dictionaries. Flask provides built-in functionality to automatically convert Python dictionaries into JSON responses, simplifying the process of returning data from your API."
