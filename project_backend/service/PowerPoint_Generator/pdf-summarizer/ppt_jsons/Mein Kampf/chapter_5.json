This chapter focuses on Hitler's perspective of the events surrounding the onset of World War I and his enlistment. We'll begin by examining the feelings around the coming war, the long period of peace that preceded it and Hitler's own feeling of excitement at war's eruption. Before the war, Hitler saw the world as bland. It would come as a surprise to him when it erupted into action again."

Hitler saw Germany as being at stake, not simply the Archduke's assassination or the potential loss of Austrian Slav territories. The assassination gave him the opportunity to prove his patriotism through action."

The realities of war changed people, and as a man at the front, Hitler's view was no different. The front became the primary focus for him and his unit as the glamour of it all faded."
