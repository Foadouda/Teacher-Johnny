            "script": "Let's begin by looking at Hitler's arrival in Vienna. This city would play a massive role in shaping his worldview. He arrived brimming with confidence, ready to ace the entrance exams to the Academy of Fine Arts. He thought his drawing skills were top-notch. The rejection from the general painting school was not expected. The Academy Rector actually suggested that Adolf had a knack for architectural design."

This presented another problem: He lacked the academic qualifications for architecture school. This setback, along with his mother's death, led to years of poverty and hardship in Vienna. But this era taught him valuable lessons of hard work, resilience and the plight of lower classes."

Despite the hardships, he dedicated himself to self-education, reading extensively. During this time his worldview took shape, forming the foundation for his later political career. Through personal experience, he saw through superficial appearances to understand people's inner natures and their living conditions."
