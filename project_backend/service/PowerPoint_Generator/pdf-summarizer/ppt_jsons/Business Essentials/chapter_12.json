            "script": "Hello everyone, welcome to the session on developing and pricing products. We'll start by understanding what exactly constitutes a product in marketing terms.  A product is more than just a physical item; it's a bundle of value designed to satisfy a need or want. Think about the features it has, and how those features translate into real benefits for the customer. Remember that classifying products as consumer or organizational products will influence marketing strategies."

Convenience items, are those everyday purchases, while shopping and specialty items require more thought and research. Marketers use different strategies for each category to attract the right customers."

Private brands are those brands that are owned by the retailer or distributor and not the actual manufacturer. For example, CVS makes a version of Advil, but it is sold as the CVS brand. Then we have packaging. A strong packaging effort will decrease spoilage and increase visual appeal."

Finally, online sellers can use fixed or dynamic pricing."

Then we have psychological pricing that takes advantage of the fact that consumers do not always make purchasing decisions based on pure, clear-cut economic value. We also have sales where we give discounts during a specific period. This concludes our session. I'll now take your questions."
