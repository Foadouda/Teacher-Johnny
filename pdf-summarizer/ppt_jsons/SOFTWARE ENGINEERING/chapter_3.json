            "script": "Welcome everyone, to today's lesson on Agile Software Development! This chapter addresses a key methodology used widely in the field. We'll explore what agile development means, how it contrasts with more traditional approaches, and some popular examples of agile methods. This slide introduces Agile methods as a reaction to the overhead in plan-driven systems. Key aspects of Agile methods involve working code, fewer documents, and valuing the developers involved."

            "script": "Here are the core tenets that embody Agile thinking. This is based on the Agile manifesto. The manifesto values individuals and interactions over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. This highlights the essence of Agility. It also acknowledges the value of the things on the right, but puts higher priority on the items on the left."

            "script": "It's crucial to understand where agile methods fit best. They thrive in product development and custom systems with strong customer participation and limited external constraints. However, they may not be suitable for very large systems or critical systems where complete specifications are a must. So the applicability of Agile really depends on the kind of project that is being addressed."

            "script": "XP practices continue with pair programming and collective ownership. Pair programming provides an informal code review system. By working together, the programmers share ownership in the code. Continuous integration occurs to make sure that new code that is being added doesn't affect previously implemented code. Finally, a sustainable pace should be implemented to encourage productivity and to avoid developer burnout."

This customer is a team member who provides an encapsulating of the user needs, defines acceptance tests, and also is involved in the specification. Without that high level of customer involvement, XP is difficult to enact."
