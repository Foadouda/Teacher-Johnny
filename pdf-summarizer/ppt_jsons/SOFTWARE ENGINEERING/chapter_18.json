These systems leverage multiple interconnected computers, offering immense potential for scalability and efficient resource allocation. The key is to make this distribution transparent to the user, presenting a unified experience. However, this also brings unique engineering hurdles we'll explore in the coming slides, including the need to manage unreliable networks and the added complexity of coordinating independent components."

It simplifies resource access and management. Think of it as a layered structure: presentation, data management, application logic, and data. The way we distribute these layers impacts factors like performance and manageability."

Benefit: simplified client management. Trade-off: heavy load for the server. Then we have fat clients that distribute application processing and presentation, which lightens server workload but complicates system management due to software installation and maintenance requirements on each client."
