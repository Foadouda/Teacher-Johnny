            "script": "Welcome to our first slide on Object-Oriented Design using UML. We'll start by outlining the core idea: it\u2019s about transforming a specification into something real and executable.  Think of it as a journey, not a one-shot deal. We progressively refine the design, adding more and more detail as we go along. The process involves various types of design activities including architectural, interface, component, and database design. All of these activities contribute to the creation of various design documents."

Then, several core design activities take place: architectural design setting the stage, interface design building the connections, component design detailing operations, and database design organizing the data. The outputs of these activities include: System architecture, Database Specification, Interface Specification, and Component Specification."

Structured methods use diagrams to enhance design and guide development, particularly for less experienced teams. Model-Driven Engineering or MDE builds on these ideas using abstract models. MDE emphasizes architectural models and separates general and specific models. These models have enough detail so the final system can be created from them."

            "script": "Now let's delve into Programming and Debugging. After we create the system design, it's time to implement it, which includes writing programs. Some developers start with well-understood parts, others leave these for later. Generally, programmers test the code they write and then correct the errors. Testing establishes defects, debugging fixes them. Debugging includes the need to create hypotheses and check them. This is supported with debugging tools."

When documenting you should include the context, the problem, the solution, and the expected consequences. This improves the overall design quality."
