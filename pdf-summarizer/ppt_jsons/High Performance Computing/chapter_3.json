We'll start by discussing the fundamental concept of parallelism, where a problem is divided into smaller, manageable tasks that are executed simultaneously to reduce the overall processing time. Shared-memory systems offer a common memory space, simplifying data sharing between processors. However, efficient parallelism requires careful planning to decompose the problem effectively and minimize communication overhead. Finally, we'll briefly touch upon Amdahl's Law, which highlights the limitations of parallelism due to the inherently sequential portions of the program."

When one processor modifies its cached copy, other caches and main memory can become inconsistent, leading to incorrect results. Two main protocols address this: Write-invalidate protocols force other caches to discard their stale copies upon a write operation. Alternatively, Write-update protocols update all cached copies and main memory, immediately propagating the changes. Both have their advantages and disadvantages."
