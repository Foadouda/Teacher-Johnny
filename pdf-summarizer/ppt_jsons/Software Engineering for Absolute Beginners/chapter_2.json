Containers are like lightweight virtual machines that package up everything your application needs to run correctly. This ensures it will work the same way across different environments, which minimizes issues and makes deploying the application simpler."

It's essentially a set of instructions that Docker uses to assemble your application's environment, from the base operating system to the final application code. Using Dockerfiles helps ensure that your builds are reproducible and consistent."
